# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

By Ekaterina Cratcha

Link to the project on my [Github Pages](https://cratcha.github.io/web_project_3/).

This is a webpage that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees.  
The main goal was to learn how to make responsive websites using Media Queries. 
I also used Flexbox and grid to position elements according to the brief. 
Figma was used for design specifications.
